# FiveM-BEA
Start FiveM with Bleeding Edge Assets.

## Introduction
When a server on FiveM updates its assets, like vehicles, it is required that you go into FiveM's `cache` folder and delete all files and folders except the `game` folder. Once you relaunch FiveM and log into a server, the assets will be forced to redownload.

## Why do I need FiveM-BEA?
Maybe you don't like navigating to the FiveM `cache` folder all the time? Maybe you often miss server announcements regarding new assets and keep missing out?! **_Maybe you are a developer that keeps uploading new assets, restarting the server, and wondering why your new assets aren't working because you, AGAIN, forgot to clear your FiveM cache?!!!_** If any of that sounds familiar, proceed to installation...

## Download
  * Latest version: https://github.com/StarkGamingMad/FiveM-BEA/releases/latest

## Installation Instructions
**Step 1:** Navigate to your FiveM Application Location:
  * Usually found in: `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\FiveM`. _Be sure to replace "USERNAME" with your username._
  * **Or, you can quickly access this location by either:**
    * Going to the Start Menu and selecting `Run`. Then, in the **Open field**, type: `%AppData%\..\Local\FiveM`, then hit the `OK` button.
    * Or, in the **Address Bar** of `Windows Explorer`, type: `%AppData%\..\Local\FiveM`, then hit the `Enter key` on the keyboard.

**Step 2:** Place `FiveM-BEA.exe` in that folder.

**Step 3:** Right click on the `FiveM-BEA.exe` file to create a Shortcut to place on your Desktop, Start Menu, or Taskbar.

**Step 4:** Run **FiveM-BEA** from your shortcut whenever you want to make sure you have the latest and greatest assets, and don't mind waiting a few extra minutes while logging into your favorite server for the assets to redownload. Otherwise, if the server you play on rarely does updates, or you aren't a developer, just launch your FiveM from its regular shortcut.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows SmartScreen Protection

`Windows protected your PC. Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.`

**Step 1:** Hit `More info`, then `Run anyway`.

### Anti-Virus Protection

Your anti-virus may try to quarantine the file, choose `Report False Positive` or equivalent action to tell the anti-virus to disregard and allow you to keep the file. You may need to re-run **FiveM-BEA** after telling your anti-virus to allow it, as they may not automatically launch it for you.
